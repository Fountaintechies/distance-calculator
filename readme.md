Goal Setting Software - V1
----------------------------------------

Purpose
The idea is to go away from the numerous project tracking software and to-do list and come up with a simple goal setting software.
We should be able to have some goals set . Rewarded if we achieve them and punished if we don't achieve them.

The application will primarily be on mobile as well as web. Syncronise the data for ease of use.
-----------------------------------------

How it works
----------------------------------------

1. Add goal
The idea is to add a goal, simple anf fun. Add a one liner, a date and time to complete it.
2. What happens when it is added
1. It will alert an user to complete it one hour before the due time.
2. It will alert an user to update it at the exact time when it was suppose to complete.
3. It will again alert 2 hours later with 1st warning.
4. It will again alert 5 hours later with 2nd warning.
5. It will start sending positive affirmations to the user to start thinking about how he can manage time and be realistic to complete it.
6. After 24 hrs. It will just send him negative messages to make sure he understands the real meaning of completion.

2. There are only 2 types of goals a person has
1. Personal
2. Business

We allow him to add them and show him the 2 types of goals.
